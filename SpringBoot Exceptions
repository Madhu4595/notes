1. java.util.NoSuchElementException: No value present
       => Given Primary key is not found in the database.

3. Circular References Exception: => spring.main.allow-circular-references=true

4. org.springframework.dao.IncorrectResultSizeDataAccessException: 
       query did not return a unique result: 2; 
       nested exception is javax.persistence.NonUniqueResultException: query did not return a unique result: 2

5. java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Can not set boolean field com.iti.entity.Iti.vtp to null value
       => your created a variable with data type boolean (Ex: private boolean pass;) but in the database null values are available for that column, 
       you need to change return type of the variable to Boolean (Ex: private Boolean pass;) then it's works fine
       => Reason: 
                => boolean is a primitive type, and can have a value of only true or false.
                => Whereas Boolean is a Wrapper Object and can be given a null value.
                => From Java 1.5 AutoBoxing is provided, so you can convert boolean to Boolean and back to boolean with Simple assignment operator (=), 
                        So you can do this in places where you want Boolean instead of boolean.
